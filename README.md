# ModulOmics
Infers cancer driver modules from DNA, RNA, PPI and regulatory network.

ModulOmics is a method to identify cancer driver pathways de novo by integrating multiple data types (protein-protein interactions, mutual exclusivity of mutations or copy number alterations, transcriptional co-regulation, and RNA co-expression) into a single probabilistic model. ModulOmics uses patient data, and protein-protein interaction networks, based here on the Hippie database and regulatory connections, based here on the Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining database (TRRUST).
